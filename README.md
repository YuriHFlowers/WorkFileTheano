# AI-track

Work file by Yuri Hernandez Flores

## Course Overview

The course's main purpose is to _bridge the gap_ between curious and solution oriented _individuals_ and _companies_ in need of capable people. It is to provide the most fundamental knowledge to the students so that they can understand what AI is.

## Requirements

List of minimal requirements for the trainees:

- junior development skills (in any programming language)
- basic math & statistics knowledge
- fundamental computer know-how (interested in tech, tech-savvy)
- problem solver mindset
- motivated
- self-learner

## Course content

BeCode promotes a learning experience based on _projects rather than lessons_.
With that in mind this course content has been divided in multiple categories of
challenges, resources and other tools aiming to teach specific sets of skills.

## Target skills

With an ever-growing and changing set of _things to know_ we made choices so
that, by the end of the training, the learner will have acquired the following
technical foundations and soft skills.

### Tech skills

By the end of the common trunk, trainees should have acquired a good
_infrastructure affinity_, good _coding background_ (with good practices and
secure coding) and the fundamentals of _ΑΙ_ and _data science_, allowing them to continue
learning on their own and in the work place.

More specifically:

- Able to deconstruct falsehood.
- General knowledge, competences and good practices.
- Able to understand modern tools and techniques.

### Soft skills

- Continuous Learner: Eager to learn, professional learner.
- Team Player: Helps, asks for help, takes its share of the collective load,
  give and takes constructive feedback.
- Reliable: Trustworthy, committed, punctual.
- Change Enthusiast: Flexible, solution mindset.

### Careers

With this training, our learners should be able to pursue the following career paths, to continue learning while acquiring battlefield experience:

- **Data analyst** : Data analysts are focused on Business development : they sift through data and seek to identify trends. What stories do the numbers tell? What business decisions can be made based on these insights? They may also create visual representations, such as charts and graphs to better showcase what the data reveals.
- **Data Scientist** : Data Scientists develop, construct, test and maintain architectures, such as databases and large-scale processing systems.
- **Machine Learning Engineer** : The ML Engineer is an expert in using data to training models. The models are then used to automate processes like image classification, speech recognition, and market forecasting.

BeCode helps graduates find an internship, hopefully converting into a job that they like, and at the same time, help partner companies staff up with our autonomous, eager to learn and reliable talents.

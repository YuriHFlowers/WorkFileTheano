The business mogul was seen with Australian actress Natasha Bassett, enjoying a meal together at a very expensive hotel, where rooms cost upwards of $1,300 (£1,030) – wow. Rumours first surfaced that the two were an item back in February when they were spotted getting off Musk’s private jet in LA. The romance between 50-year-old Musk and 27-year-old Bassett comes after he split from ex-girlfriend Grimes in September, while they welcomed their second child via surrogate in December. Since then, Bassett has been spotted at multiple events with the CEO, including Cannes film festival with his mother. In the new photos, the couple can be seen dining at the Cheval Blanc hotel, St Tropez, but its hefty price tag is surely a drop in the ocean for the world’s richest man . Musk and Bassett sat in full view of the hotel’s pool and bathers, sipping on rosé, eating French fries and chatting animatedly while waiters fluttered by. The pair then strolled hand-in-hand out of the expensive eatery past other sunseekers on the beach. Bassett looked elegant wearing a pricey Zadig and Voltaire dress, silver sandals and a matching bag. Meanwhile, Musk, who was dressed less suitably for the weather, wore a dark grey t-shirt, black jeans and black leather Chelsea boots. This is the pair’s second sighting over recent days, as on Saturday they were seen enjoying dinner at the hotel’s five star restaurant. If you haven’t heard of Bassett, before you might become more familiar with her following the release of Baz Luhrmann’s upcoming Elvis biopic, in which she stars. On May 26, Musk’s mother Maye shared a photo on her Instagram story with Bassett when the two arrived for a Cannes premiere, suggesting she’s already well in with his family, with Maye showing her some love with emoji hearts next to her tag. The two ladies did not walk the carpet together and were careful to not be seen in the same shot at the event, though. In 2017, Bassett starred in the unauthorised Lifetime Britney Spears biopic, Britney Ever After. As for Musk, with a £168billion fortune, the maverick genius whose Tesla electric cars have revolutionised the motor industry, has a private life just as colourful as his professional one. In March, Musk and his long-time on-off – and currently off – girlfriend Grimes , a Canadian singer whose real name is Claire Boucher, decided to call their daughter â€. The child, born three months after the couple split, had been kept a secret until Grimes, 33, gave an interview to Vanity Fair magazine and the reporter heard a baby crying in a bedroom of her rented modest $40,000 ranch home in a quiet suburb of Austin, Texas, near Tesla’s HQ. But it was when she revealed the baby’s name that the global headlines and internet memes â€ exploded into life. It was never likely that new Baby Musk would have a conventional moniker, though. After all, the tycoon’s first child with Grimes, a son born in May 2020, was christened X AE A-12 (pronounced X Ash A Twelve) and is known as X. When asked about his unusual name, Grimes said that it was a nod to their love of science fiction and the mythology of elves. In an explanation some might find mystifying, she continued: ‘X, the unknown variable. AE, my elven spelling of AI (artificial intelligence), A-12, a precursor to SR-17, our favourite aircraft. No weapons, no defences, just speed. Great in battle, but non-violent.’ Lucas Torreira tells Arsenal his preferred move after Fiorentina's rejected offer Man who won $10,000,000 jailed for life for shooting sleeping girlfriend dead Do Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have to be in court when the trial verdict is read? Her account of their decision to call their daughter Y was equally baffling, explaining that Exa is a reference to a measure of supercomputer performance. Elsewhere in Musk’s life, another of his exes is loved up once more, with Talulah Riley dating actor Thomas Brodie-Sangster , after love blossomed on the Pistol set. We just can’t keep up!

Deepfakes are “photoshopped” videos - fake videos showing people saying things they never really said. Their creators leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies to create super convincing videos, which are getting more and more difficult to distinguish from legitimate content. To make them convincing, though, deepfakes require significant computing power, not unlike the one on offer through the Colab service.

(opens in new tab) As deepfakes are usually used to crack jokes, create fake news, or spread fake revenge porn, it’s easy to think ethics are behind Google’s decision. However, it might also be that too many people were using Colab to create fun little deepfake videos, preventing other researchers from doing more “serious” work. After all, the computing resource is free to use. Besides deepfakes, Google doesn’t allow Colab to be used on projects such as mining cryptocurrency, running denial-of-service attacks, password cracking, using multiple accounts to work around access or resource usage restrictions, using a remote desktop or SSH, or connecting to remote proxies.

The venture is described as the first of its kind in the UK and will look to accelerate the adoption of private cellular technology in a range of industries, including education, retail, healthcare, transport and logistics industries and beyond. While many businesses will use public 5G network for their needs, a private equivalent provides dedicated access to a specific customer, using either licensed, unlicensed, or shared spectrum, with no resources shared by any third party. By pursuing this route, customers can define the scale, pace of rollout, and technology used, while guaranteeing a certain level of performance for their applications. Private networks can be built with or without the assistance of a traditional mobile operator, with many IT firms and telecoms equipment manufacturers now selling products and services directly to end users. BT and Ericsson’s partnership combines each company’s respective strengths to deliver the best of all worlds. Specifically, BT has experience of working directly with businesses and of converging fixed and mobile networks, while Ericsson is one of the leading manufacturers of 5G technology. > AWS wants to let all businesses build their own 5G networks (opens in new tab) > Demand for private 4G and 5G set to create multi-billion-dollar market by 2024 (opens in new tab) > Half of CIOs plan private 5G network within next two years (opens in new tab) While many private cellular networks are powered by 4G, 5G offers significant advances in speed, capacity, and latency. This enhances coverage and allows mission-critical applications that require high performance, reliability connectivity and real-time data to be powered by a mobile network for the first time. The two companies have already worked together on several projects, including a smart port environment at Belfast Harbour in Northern Ireland. The deal reflects Ericsson’s desire to secure more of the enterprise market and BT’s ambition to increase revenues through new technologies. It has committed to invest £100 million over the next three years in its ‘Division X’ unit to accelerate the development of services that combine emerging technologies like 5G, IoT, edge computing and artificial intelligence (AI). “We have combined our skill and expertise at building converged fixed and mobile networks with Ericsson’s leading, sustainable, and secure 5G network equipment, to offer a pioneering new proposition that will be attractive to many industries,” said Marc Overton, BT Division X managing director. “5G private networks will also support smart factory processes and the advancement of Industry 4.0 which can realise significant cost savings and efficiencies for manufacturers. “They also provide the foundation to overlay other innovative technologies such as IoT, AI, VR and AR, opening up a multitude of possibilities.” “The high quality, fast and secure connectivity provided by Ericsson Private 5G can help organisations make all-important efficiency gains that can create safer, more productive, and sustainable business operations and help the country build global leaders in the industries and technologies of the future,” added Katherine Ainley, CEO Ericsson UK & Ireland. A study by IDC says that growing awareness and emerging use cases for private cellular networks is driving the uptake, with 5G starting to become a factor in a market that is still driven by the LTE standard. Accordingly, the market for private 4G and 5G infrastructure will surge from $1.7 billion in 2021 to $8.3 billion by 2026 – an annual growth rate of 35.7%.', 'pubDate': '2022-05-31 14:08:39', 'image_url': None, 'source_id': 'techradar', 'country': ['india', 'australia'], 'category': ['technology'], 'language': 'english'}, {'title': \"Go Global Retail and Janie and Jack acquire Brums Milano, a leading premium children's fashion brand from Preca Brummel SpA\", 'link': 'https://www.iltempo.it/adnkronos/2022/05/31/news/go-global-retail-and-janie-and-jack-acquire-brums-milano-a-leading-premium-children-s-fashion-brand-from-preca-brummel-spa-31819415/', 'keywords': None, 'creator': None, 'video_url': None, 'description': '- The acquisition is the latest strategic investment by Go Global LOS ANGELES, May 31, 2022 /PRNewswire/ --\\xa0Go Global Retail\\xa0today announced it has acquired\\xa0Brums\\xa0Milano,\\xa0a leader in premium children\\'s fashion with more than 150 corporate and franchise store locations in Italy, as well as strong online presence, offering apparel, footwear and accessories.

Please note the prohibited actions specified in our FAQ.” Google appears to have made the change under the radar, and has since remained quiet on the matter.

Deepfakes are “photoshopped” videos - fake videos showing people saying things they never really said. Their creators leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies to create super convincing videos, which are getting more and more difficult to distinguish from legitimate content. To make them convincing, though, deepfakes require significant computing power, not unlike the one on offer through the Colab service.

(opens in new tab) As deepfakes are usually used to crack jokes, create fake news, or spread fake revenge porn, it’s easy to think ethics are behind Google’s decision. However, it might also be that too many people were using Colab to create fun little deepfake videos, preventing other researchers from doing more “serious” work. After all, the computing resource is free to use. Besides deepfakes, Google doesn’t allow Colab to be used on projects such as mining cryptocurrency, running denial-of-service attacks, password cracking, using multiple accounts to work around access or resource usage restrictions, using a remote desktop or SSH, or connecting to remote proxies.

The venture is described as the first of its kind in the UK and will look to accelerate the adoption of private cellular technology in a range of industries, including education, retail, healthcare, transport and logistics industries and beyond. While many businesses will use public 5G network for their needs, a private equivalent provides dedicated access to a specific customer, using either licensed, unlicensed, or shared spectrum, with no resources shared by any third party. By pursuing this route, customers can define the scale, pace of rollout, and technology used, while guaranteeing a certain level of performance for their applications. Private networks can be built with or without the assistance of a traditional mobile operator, with many IT firms and telecoms equipment manufacturers now selling products and services directly to end users. BT and Ericsson’s partnership combines each company’s respective strengths to deliver the best of all worlds. Specifically, BT has experience of working directly with businesses and of converging fixed and mobile networks, while Ericsson is one of the leading manufacturers of 5G technology. > AWS wants to let all businesses build their own 5G networks (opens in new tab) > Demand for private 4G and 5G set to create multi-billion-dollar market by 2024 (opens in new tab) > Half of CIOs plan private 5G network within next two years (opens in new tab) While many private cellular networks are powered by 4G, 5G offers significant advances in speed, capacity, and latency. This enhances coverage and allows mission-critical applications that require high performance, reliability connectivity and real-time data to be powered by a mobile network for the first time. The two companies have already worked together on several projects, including a smart port environment at Belfast Harbour in Northern Ireland. The deal reflects Ericsson’s desire to secure more of the enterprise market and BT’s ambition to increase revenues through new technologies. It has committed to invest £100 million over the next three years in its ‘Division X’ unit to accelerate the development of services that combine emerging technologies like 5G, IoT, edge computing and artificial intelligence (AI). “We have combined our skill and expertise at building converged fixed and mobile networks with Ericsson’s leading, sustainable, and secure 5G network equipment, to offer a pioneering new proposition that will be attractive to many industries,” said Marc Overton, BT Division X managing director. “5G private networks will also support smart factory processes and the advancement of Industry 4.0 which can realise significant cost savings and efficiencies for manufacturers. “They also provide the foundation to overlay other innovative technologies such as IoT, AI, VR and AR, opening up a multitude of possibilities.” “The high quality, fast and secure connectivity provided by Ericsson Private 5G can help organisations make all-important efficiency gains that can create safer, more productive, and sustainable business operations and help the country build global leaders in the industries and technologies of the future,” added Katherine Ainley, CEO Ericsson UK & Ireland. A study by IDC says that growing awareness and emerging use cases for private cellular networks is driving the uptake, with 5G starting to become a factor in a market that is still driven by the LTE standard. Accordingly, the market for private 4G and 5G infrastructure will surge from $1.7 billion in 2021 to $8.3 billion by 2026 – an annual growth rate of 35.7%.', 'pubDate': '2022-05-31 14:08:39', 'image_url': None, 'source_id': 'techradar', 'country': ['india', 'australia'], 'category': ['technology'], 'language': 'english'}, {'title': \"Go Global Retail and Janie and Jack acquire Brums Milano, a leading premium children's fashion brand from Preca Brummel SpA\", 'link': 'https://www.iltempo.it/adnkronos/2022/05/31/news/go-global-retail-and-janie-and-jack-acquire-brums-milano-a-leading-premium-children-s-fashion-brand-from-preca-brummel-spa-31819415/', 'keywords': None, 'creator': None, 'video_url': None, 'description': '- The acquisition is the latest strategic investment by Go Global LOS ANGELES, May 31, 2022 /PRNewswire/ --\\xa0Go Global Retail\\xa0today announced it has acquired\\xa0Brums\\xa0Milano,\\xa0a leader in premium children\\'s fashion with more than 150 corporate and franchise store locations in Italy, as well as strong online presence, offering apparel, footwear and accessories.

When he tried to train his deepfake models on the platform, he got an error message, saying “You may be executing code that is disallowed, and this may restrict your ability to use Colab in the future. Please note the prohibited actions specified in our FAQ.” Google appears to have made the change under the radar, and has since remained quiet on the matter.

Deepfakes are “photoshopped” videos - fake videos showing people saying things they never really said. Their creators leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies to create super convincing videos, which are getting more and more difficult to distinguish from legitimate content. To make them convincing, though, deepfakes require significant computing power, not unlike the one on offer through the Colab service.

(opens in new tab) As deepfakes are usually used to crack jokes, create fake news, or spread fake revenge porn, it’s easy to think ethics are behind Google’s decision. However, it might also be that too many people were using Colab to create fun little deepfake videos, preventing other researchers from doing more “serious” work. After all, the computing resource is free to use. Besides deepfakes, Google doesn’t allow Colab to be used on projects such as mining cryptocurrency, running denial-of-service attacks, password cracking, using multiple accounts to work around access or resource usage restrictions, using a remote desktop or SSH, or connecting to remote proxies.

The venture is described as the first of its kind in the UK and will look to accelerate the adoption of private cellular technology in a range of industries, including education, retail, healthcare, transport and logistics industries and beyond. While many businesses will use public 5G network for their needs, a private equivalent provides dedicated access to a specific customer, using either licensed, unlicensed, or shared spectrum, with no resources shared by any third party. By pursuing this route, customers can define the scale, pace of rollout, and technology used, while guaranteeing a certain level of performance for their applications. Private networks can be built with or without the assistance of a traditional mobile operator, with many IT firms and telecoms equipment manufacturers now selling products and services directly to end users. BT and Ericsson’s partnership combines each company’s respective strengths to deliver the best of all worlds. Specifically, BT has experience of working directly with businesses and of converging fixed and mobile networks, while Ericsson is one of the leading manufacturers of 5G technology. > AWS wants to let all businesses build their own 5G networks (opens in new tab) > Demand for private 4G and 5G set to create multi-billion-dollar market by 2024 (opens in new tab) > Half of CIOs plan private 5G network within next two years (opens in new tab) While many private cellular networks are powered by 4G, 5G offers significant advances in speed, capacity, and latency. This enhances coverage and allows mission-critical applications that require high performance, reliability connectivity and real-time data to be powered by a mobile network for the first time. The two companies have already worked together on several projects, including a smart port environment at Belfast Harbour in Northern Ireland. The deal reflects Ericsson’s desire to secure more of the enterprise market and BT’s ambition to increase revenues through new technologies. It has committed to invest £100 million over the next three years in its ‘Division X’ unit to accelerate the development of services that combine emerging technologies like 5G, IoT, edge computing and artificial intelligence (AI). “We have combined our skill and expertise at building converged fixed and mobile networks with Ericsson’s leading, sustainable, and secure 5G network equipment, to offer a pioneering new proposition that will be attractive to many industries,” said Marc Overton, BT Division X managing director. “5G private networks will also support smart factory processes and the advancement of Industry 4.0 which can realise significant cost savings and efficiencies for manufacturers. “They also provide the foundation to overlay other innovative technologies such as IoT, AI, VR and AR, opening up a multitude of possibilities.” “The high quality, fast and secure connectivity provided by Ericsson Private 5G can help organisations make all-important efficiency gains that can create safer, more productive, and sustainable business operations and help the country build global leaders in the industries and technologies of the future,” added Katherine Ainley, CEO Ericsson UK & Ireland. A study by IDC says that growing awareness and emerging use cases for private cellular networks is driving the uptake, with 5G starting to become a factor in a market that is still driven by the LTE standard. Accordingly, the market for private 4G and 5G infrastructure will surge from $1.7 billion in 2021 to $8.3 billion by 2026 – an annual growth rate of 35.7%.', 'pubDate': '2022-05-31 14:08:39', 'image_url': None, 'source_id': 'techradar', 'country': ['india', 'australia'], 'category': ['technology'], 'language': 'english'})\n",
